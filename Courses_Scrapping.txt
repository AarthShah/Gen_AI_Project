Excellent Teaching, concept clearance and doubt clearing. Thank you sir for taking this wonderful session. Before this session I have only theory knowledge but now I am comfortable in code and logic also.
really enjoyed the approach of explaining DS. It was good. Cleared all the doubts which I have asked with no rush, maintained simplicity in teaching with each topics.
I don’t owe my professional success to my destiny, courage, luck, belief, confidence or fortune. I owe it to a wonderful scholar like you. Nothing can come close to the inspirational presence of an instructor like you in a student’s journey. You have no idea how important a role you play in shaping my research development, maybe we did not meet a lot, but those little encouragement words means a lot to me. I really enjoyed all of the readings and found they were diverse and inclusive. I learned a lot. Thank you for allowing us space to not only have dialogue but be creative within our assignments as well. I really learned some useful tips and tricks for DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS which will help me in "Competitive Programming" as well. Thank you for being so encouraging and doing everything you can to keep us motivated and supported throughout our program. Your knowledge and leadership provide us with a priceless model for our own careers. Your diligence and direction have inspired my inner confidence to climb like a Tiger until I reach the pinnacle of my ambitions. One of the best decisions I had a fantastic time by taking your course in such Lock-Down period due to the COVID Pandemic. Thank you for loving your job so much! You are an amazing teacher! 
It was an amazing course as I imagined. Because of Nilesh sir's lecture, I got depth knowledge of data structure and I’m sure this is more than enough to build my upcoming career. Sunbeam provides the best facilities of video lectures too and because of this facility, I personally got many profits if I forgot any concept I goes through these lectures and it will help me to understand these concepts. The enthusiasm which sunbeam provides always gives us good fruit. Thank you Sunbeam.
The way of your explanation is excellent. I have learned first time Data structure and Algorithms but never felt tough in understanding at any moment. All the contents of data structures and algorithms learned very well and easily. Thank you very much, sir.  
First of all, thank you for sharing your precious knowledge in a very efficient manner because even if I'm from none IT background I understood all things expertly. I'm sure that it will be very helpful throughout my career. Thank you ðŸ˜Š 
The best thing about the course is that this course is very punctual about timing and syllabus. None of the single point is not skipped. and in learning time there is a motivated environment. Nilesh sir's way of teaching is awesome now I am big fan of sir. As I am a last year student many of the concepts is not cleared but after this course, I have that confidence that I am really good in DSA. Thank you nilesh sir and Sunbeam Team......!!! 
all sessions are very well explained, understood very well, it will surely help me in dac course as data structure is a part of syllabus, the way of teaching was interesting, i enjoyed learning during course. Thanks a lot. 
Best approach to learn Ds is to learn through the basic and to learn basics is know basic .. the whole process by Nilesh sir made me understand Data structure in very simple way and to made an environment where we had an open discussion on of doubts without thinking whether to ask or not... Thanks a lot sir as beginner in data structure you have made me expert in ds what I need is now a paper work. So thanks a lot sir and thanks to vishal sir for helping me solve the basic problems.

The excellent teaching style and excellent understanding of teaching topics. What I like the most about the course is how Amit Sir helps to improve visualization of code using proper diagrams and images. Also, proper sequencing of sample examples helps to revise the topic in the future. It’s good that sir gives more time on basic topics in the beginning so that the foundation is strong. Your knowledge and leadership provide us with a priceless model for our own careers. I am so happy you are part of my education. I learned to truly care about diversity and inclusion through your classes, and I hope now spread that message in a passionate but thoughtful way. You’re awesome!
Amazing skill of teaching and a very well structured course for people to start to learn to machine learning. The assignments are very good for understanding the practical side of machine learning. To all those thinking of getting in ML, this is a must-have course. Kindly continue these online sessions post COVID-19 pandemic. It's really helpful for those who cannot come to the institute due to timing issues /working out of Pune etc. but willing to learn from you all.
Thank You.
Kudos to Sunbeam and Amit Sir again, for conducting Machine Learning with Python course in such a great manner. Amit Sir teaching as always is very precise and he goes out of this schedule to answer and cover, each and every doubt of the students and the topic in the syllabus. The course was also extended by a week, so as to cover all the topics in a meticulous manner.
Thank you Amit Sir and Sunbeam once again :)

--- Student Feedback: for Python Development
The course content was well-structured and covered all the essential topics needed to build a solid foundation in Python programming. What stood out the most for me was the clarity with which the  concepts were explained. Sir went above and beyond by covering additional topics that were incredibly valuable. I now feel much more confident in my Python skills, thanks to this course. 
I can genuinely say it was one of the most enriching learning experiences I’ve had. I was referred by a colleague to join SUNBEAM, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect initially, but from the very first session, it became clear that I was in the hands of an exceptional teacher. Sir has an extraordinary talent for simplifying even the most complex Python concepts, making them easy to grasp for all students. 
His explanations are consistently clear, and he demonstrates remarkable patience, ensuring that every question is answered thoroughly and that no one is left behind. What truly stood out to me was his practical approach to teaching – beyond just theory, he provided real-world examples that made it easy to see how Python could be applied in my professional work. Sir's dedication to his students is truly admirable. 
I now feel confident in my Python skills and am eager to apply what I’ve learned in my career. His teaching style, depth of knowledge, and unwavering support are truly exceptional, and I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be taught by him.
To be honest, Python was my first authentic experience of learning programming language and this
experience was made memorable by you sir. Older me was saying programming is soo boring, soo complicated, an headache. But sir you totally changed my perspective. Now, I have gained confidence
that I too can develop applications.
You just have not only taught us python, You taught insights of python. how python works internally. I never ever trained like this before. You showed the way how to look at concepts insights just not syntax. Its Conceptual + Insights + syntactical Training I got. My words are not enough to express the gratitude but still to get teacher like you needs luck also.
The quizzes at the end of each module were also a great way to test my knowledge. The Q&A sessions 15-20 mins before and after each lecture added more value to it. The example of  "Potter and Stencils" was amazing to understand the difference between "Java and Pythons class". Similarly the example of (2 or more) parallel projects while teaching the concept of working with "Virtual Environment" was amazing. 
Request the sunbeam management to please start such courses for Ex-CDAC students which helps the CDAC family to grow and show what the CDAC pupils can do with CDAC gurus showing us the way ahead. It would be needless to praise our CDAC guru’s knowledge. Teaching methodologies as doing classes from US at 4:30 am PST time I always had a smile on my face a kid like zeal to learn what Sir would bring to the table that day and by end of min 2:30 hrs of a lecture he would leave us in awe. I would say CDAC sunbeam is not an institutional at all, it more of a Gurukul where the pupils are lifelong connected to the Gurus here at Sunbeam like Nilesh Sir,(for motivating when I was about to quit CDAC coming from ECE background), Prashant Sir, Vijay Sir, Sameer Sir(had a magical experience when he taught us in 2011 Feb) , Sarang Sir(never thought that Software engineering subject could be fun and also be taught)
